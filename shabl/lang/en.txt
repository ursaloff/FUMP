SENDING_DELAY_DESCR	*) Critical settings. Ensure you choose the correct setting!<br><br>Warning: Use non-zero value for "Delay between emails" only if you have performance issues with your server, a limit for sending messages or if you are on a shared web server. A delay will be added between each email to be sent and will result in slower delivery of your emails. For example your server can send 10 messages per second (36.000 messages per hour) if the delay is set to 1 second per email, the added delay will be 36.000 seconds (10 hours). As result all emails will be completely sent after 11 hours.

	<h2>Setting bounce headers tips. </h2>
                    <p>If you are going to process bounced messages you can define 
                      bounce send options there.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Attention!</strong></font> 
                      Bounced messages can be returned with default settings.
                      You need to define or check the bounce options if you cannot find bounced 
                      messages in your mailboxes. Alternatively specify a separate mailbox which 
                      must be different from your “From” or “Reply-To” addresses.</p>
                    <p>Usually all bounced messages should be returned to the email in the 
                      Return-path header in your messages. There are a few ways 
                      to accomplish this.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>SMTP</u></strong></p>
                    <p>If you are using SMTP to send your messages you can specify 
                      a different email address from your 'From' or 'Reply-To' headers. 
                      You need to check 'Email address to receive bounced emails' 
                      checkbox and specify the email address. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong><u>Setup using the Sendmail Command</u></strong></p>
                    <p>The result might not be optimal, but there are good alternatives: </p>
                    <p><br>
                      <strong><em>Technique 1:</em></strong> The -f flag</p>
                    <p>You need to check 'Use sendmail -f flag' and specify email 
                      address there</p>
                    <p>This should set the Return-Path header.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Technique 2: </strong></em>Return-Path header</p>
                    <p>If that doesn't work, you can try to set the Return-Path 
                      header explicitly. This is not the best way by any means, 
                      but Qmail allows you to do this.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Technique 3: </strong>”Errors-To” header</p>
                    <p>The “Errors-To” header seems to have been created just for 
                      this task, but it's actually a deprecated header. Use it
                      with caution. For it to do anything, you need to configure 
                      Sendmail to actually see the “Errors-To” header. If the previous
                      techniques fail you can try to specify the “Errors-To” header.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>To test any of these configurations, send yourself 
                      a test message and view the source of the message itself 
                      in your mail reader. In the mail headers you should see 
                      the Return-Path header like:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><code>Return-Path: &lt;johndoe@domain.net&gt;<br>
